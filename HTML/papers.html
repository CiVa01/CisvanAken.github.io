                Here you can find some of my academic works, including my Bachelor thesis and some papers I wrote during my studies. There is a lot more I worked on, but these are some of the highlights, chosen particularly to display my varied skill set.
                I have worked on highly technical or theoretical papers, as well as more design and user research oriented projects, as well as more ethics focussed works.

                Feel free to have a look around and reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss anything!

                <h2>Bachelor Thesis on Neuromorphic Computing</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                I wrote my thesis on Neuromorphic Computing, specifically on the energy efficiency of Neuromorphic Algorithms compared to traditional algorithms. Ultimately graded with an 8 average.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope of the project changed often throughout the project, as it was a highly complex and novel topic, that had not yet before been assigned to Bachelor students. I learned a lot about how to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty in research, as well as how to adapt to changing circumstances.

                <h2>A machine Learning model to classify MEG data</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                For a course in Machine Learning we build a model that combines LSTM and CNN units to filter both temporal and spatial data, to classify MEG data across different tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main contributions were conceptually, where I used my previous expertise in neural networks to help design the architecture of the model, as well as practically, where I collaborated on implementing the model in PyTorch, before others would run the evaluation.

                <h2>Mental Health Effects of Social Media</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                We wrote an ethical analysis of the use of Social Media and how much responsibility is with the company behind such systems, and how much is with the actual users.
            </p>
            <p>
                This work was a highly collaborative effort, where I contributed to the research and writing of the paper, developing the framework we used to analyze the ethical aspects of the problem.
