                <h1>My Education</h1>

            <h2>2019-2024: Bachelor of Science in AI, followed at Radboud University in Nijmegen.</h2>
            <P>A curriculum focussed on both technical aspects of AI, complemented with data science and data engineering techniques, as well as extensive education on the cognitive and social aspects of AI. Being part of the faculty of Social Sciences, the approach Radboud University takes towards AI is a very human one.
            The focus was often on the interaction between human and AI, as well as using AI to learn more about human cognition and perception.</P>
            <h2>2024-2026: Master of Science in HCI, Information Sciences, at Utrecht University.</h2>
            <p>Following my Bachelors, I felt like I had 2 options. I either specialize myself more into AI, or I choose a slightly different path and instead broaden my skillset.
            I chose the latter, and following this, I ended up studying Human-Computer Interaction in Utrecht. Through my elective, the curriculum is still tailored towards data, information and AI, however, I extended my skillset greatly.
            Through the Masters, I obtained the necessary skills in user research, prototyping and Human Centered software and design principles to hopefully achieve my goals.</p>
